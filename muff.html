            <p> The tried and true blueberry muffin is a recipe everyone should have in there books.  Due to their notoriety, you have to do this dish justice with just as memorable taste! </p>
            <p> These muffins are extra large and yummy with the sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top edge for a wonderful extra-generously-sized deli style muffin. Add extra blueberries too, if you want!</p>
