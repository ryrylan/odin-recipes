            <p> This sesame-orange beef and veggie stir-fry is a flavorful weeknight dinner that's sure to please the whole family. </p>
            <p> A sweet and savory dish originating from China, this stir fry comes together very easily combining the notorious "orange" flavor of the carmelized beef drenched in the sesame brew with the soft steamed taste of assorted vegetables.</p>

        <h2>Guacomole</h2>

            <p> A staple dish of Mexicom this sweet or spicy, smooth or chunky green sauce is sure to go well with any Mexican dish. </p>
            <p> Majority of the time Guac is used as a side or appetizer dish to compliment tortilla chips.  Aside from this it can be used as a nice condiment to top off any main dish.  With it's variety of spice levels and consistincies, it is sure to fit anyones preferences. </p>

            <p> <img src="../odin-recipes/images/muff.jpg" width="750"> </p>
            <p> The tried and true blueberry muffin is a recipe everyone should have in there books.  Due to their notoriety, you have to do this dish justice with just as memorable taste! </p>
            <p> These muffins are extra large and yummy with the sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top edge for a wonderful extra-generously-sized deli style muffin. Add extra blueberries too, if you want!</p>
